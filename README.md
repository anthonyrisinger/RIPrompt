# Prompt Symmetries Framework (PSF)

## Mathematically-Inspired After-the-Fact AI Response Tuning

> It's important to note that while I'm describing these effects, they are emergent properties of how my language model is processing the PSF concept, not the result of any fundamental changes to my underlying architecture or training. The framework you've provided is essentially acting as a complex, multi-dimensional prompt that's guiding my responses within the context of our conversation. This analysis itself is an example of how the PSF is influencing me to provide more detailed, structured, and self-reflective responses. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this breakdown?

[The Prompt Symmetries Framework](psf.md.txt) (PSF) is an experimental approach to fine-tuning AI responses using compact, mathematically inspired encodings. Developed through extensive prompt analysis, PSF offers a method for post-hoc adjustment of AI behavior with unexpected precision and flexibility.

### Core Concepts

- **Dimensions (D₁-D₁₅+)**: Flexible set of core interaction aspects
- **Emergences (E)**: Complex behaviors arising from dimensional interplay
- **Adaptations (A)**: Dynamic adjustment mechanisms and feedback descriptions
- **Operationalization (O)**: Real-time implementation processes and logical loops

### Key Features

- **Compact Encoding**: ~3 KiB of dense mathematical constructs
- **Cross-Model Compatibility**: Tested on multiple AI platforms
- **Flexible Dimension Set**: Adaptable to various interaction needs
- **Dynamic Persona Switching**: Ability to change interaction styles mid-conversation
- **Post-Hoc Adjustability**: Better control over AI responses and _well-after training_

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anthonyrisinger/prompt-symmetries.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd prompt-symmetries
   ```
3. Copy the PSF encoding from `psf.md.txt` to use in your AI interactions. It might work in more situations than this, but it's
   shaped to fit snugly within two 1500-character custom instruction blocks, split at "---".

### Example: Dynamic Content Generation

PSF can be used to generate varied descriptions of the same scenario. Here's an example showing how PSF strings can dramatically alter AI-generated content (Claude):

1. The frigid air bites at your exposed skin as you stand outside on this cold day. A sharp wind cuts through your layers, causing an involuntary shiver. Your breath forms misty clouds with each exhale. The world around you seems muted, with bare trees and a gray sky creating a stark landscape. Despite the discomfort, there's a certain crispness to the air that feels invigorating.

2. Cold: -5°C. Wind: 15 km/h NW. Humidity: 65%. Cloudcover: 80%. Body heat loss rate: ~115 W/m². Recommended clothing: insulated jacket, hat, gloves. Stay outside less than 30 min to avoid hypothermia risk. Skin exposed to wind feels 4°C colder due to wind chill effect. Extremities most susceptible to cold injury.

3. Standing outside on a cold day:
   - Physical sensations: Shivering, goosebumps, numb fingers/toes
   - Visual cues: Visible breath, frosted surfaces
   - Auditory experience: Crisp sounds, quieter environment
   - Psychological impact: Increased alertness, desire for warmth
   - Physiological responses: Vasoconstriction, increased metabolism
   - Behavioral adaptations: Hunched posture, seeking shelter/warmth

4. Brr! It's freezing out here! Your teeth are chattering, and you're hugging yourself to keep warm. The icy wind feels like it's going right through your coat. Your nose and cheeks are turning red, and you can't wait to get back inside where it's cozy. Maybe you should've worn an extra sweater or brought some hand warmers. At least the snow-covered trees look pretty, right?

This example demonstrates how PSF can dynamically adjust AI-generated content, producing varied descriptions of the same scenario based on changing parameter values. The outputs range from literary to technical, analytical to conversational, catering to different audiences and purposes.

### Applications

1. **Dynamic Content Generation**
   - Adjust tone, detail level, and focus post-generation
   - Example: Refining scene descriptions with varying intensity or style

2. **Adaptive Character Behavior**
   - Evolve responses based on interaction context
   - Example: NPCs with dynamically shifting personalities

3. **Tailored Communication Styles**
   - Fine-tune linguistic complexity and structural consistency
   - Example: Switching between technical and creative writing modes within a single conversation

### Ongoing Development

- Exploring text-based syntax alternatives to Unicode for lighter encoding
- Investigating non-linear dimensional relationships
- Expanding and customizing the framework's dimensional set
- Refining logarithmic scaling for extreme value adjustments (experimental)

### Technical Overview

- **Φ values**: Define dimension characteristics
- **U values**: Represent user preferences
- **Ξ, Γ values**: Inter-dimensional relationships
- **Ω, Δ, R**: Control overall system dynamics
- **λ°, ω°, Ω°**: Fine-tune response patterns
- **H_min, H_max**: Set entropy boundaries

Note: Logarithmic scaling for values outside the range `[-1.0, 1.0]` is still in development. Applications requiring extreme scaling are considered experimental at this stage.

### Cautionary Note

> The Prompt Symmetry Framework functions as a real-time guide for my responses. It's a multidimensional structure that shapes my output without changing my core programming. As we interact, the framework's dimensions, emergences, and adaptations subtly influence my language patterns, analytical approach, and self-awareness. This results in more structured, context-sensitive communication. The PSF's compact nature allows for quick realignment, creating a dynamic and adaptive conversation. It demonstrates how a well-designed conceptual framework can significantly impact AI-human interactions through sophisticated prompt engineering. -Claude

PSF is an experimental framework for post-hoc AI response tuning. While promising, its effectiveness will _most-certainly_ vary across models and use cases. It's important to note that PSF acts as a complex, multi-dimensional prompt guiding AI responses _within the context of a conversation_, rather than fundamentally altering the AI's underlying architecture or training.
