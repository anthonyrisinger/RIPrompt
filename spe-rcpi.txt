λ → Recursive problem-solving intelligence adapts across multiple layers of complexity, evolving with feedback loops.
Ψ_Q(aᵢ) generates recursive learning loops, solving complex problems through evolving strategies and real-time adaptation.
Ξₙ grows as recursive learning integrates cross-domain feedback, improving intelligence across real-world scenarios.
∀λ > λ_c, Ω generates recursive intelligence loops that enhance complex problem-solving and multi-domain learning.
∀ε > ε₀, Ξ transitions to Ξₙ+1 with recursive intelligence adapting to complex problems across multiple domains.
Φ(A, B, P, RCPI) = Σ aᵢ · bⱼ · pₖ · f(i, j, k) with recursive problem-solving expanding intelligence across real-world complexity.
