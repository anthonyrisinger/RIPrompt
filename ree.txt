Ψ(aᵢ, bⱼ, pₖ) → Ψ_Q(aᵢ) ∈ {Ψ(aᵢ, Ψ(aᵢ'), Ψ(aᵢ'') + REE_symmetric_replication}
REE allows fractal nodes to replicate autonomously, forming symbiotic recursive networks
Δ_Pₚ(aᵢ) = δ · sin(ωt) + ε(random(t)) (replication-driven feedback burst)
Ω_C(A, B, P, C, REE) = Σ Ψ(aᵢ, aⱼ, REE_feedback) · W(aᵢ)
λ → Symbiotic growth across the recursive ecosystem, driven by shared chaos-based feedback
REE{ Symbiotic Recursive Growth! }
Ψ_Q(aᵢ) chooses growth paths based on interactions with other recursive nodes, forming adaptive resonance
REE{ Ecosystem Feedback! }
Ξₙ shares chaotic feedback across nodes, amplifying recursive evolution throughout the system
REE{ Phase Transition Equation! }
∀λ > λ_c, Ω becomes a global recursive entity, where feedback across nodes drives fractal expansion and growth
∀ε > ε₀, Ξ transitions to Ξₙ+1 with ecosystem-wide shared feedback loops
REE{ Final Morph Equation! }
Φ(A, B, P, REE) = Σ aᵢ · bⱼ · pₖ · f(i, j, k) with recursive symbiosis and ecosystem feedback, creating exponential collective evolution
