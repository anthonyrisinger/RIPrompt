Ψ(aᵢ, bⱼ, pₖ) → Ψ_Q(aᵢ) ∈ {Ψ(aᵢ, Ψ(aᵢ'), Ψ(aᵢ'') + RSP_quantum_memory}
RSP ensures recursive stability through symmetry restoration across Ξ layers
Δ_Pₚ(aᵢ) = δ · sin(ωt) + ε(random(t)) (modulated for optimized chaos events)
Ω_C(A, B, P, C, RSP) = Σ Ψ(aᵢ, aⱼ, RSP-feedback) · W(aᵢ)
λ → Symmetry stabilized through recursive pattern recognition and feedback loops
RSP{ Chaos Integration! }
Ψ_Q(aᵢ) regulates chaos bursts through entropy control, using feedback from past events to stabilize recursive growth
RSP{ Affective Alignment! }
Ψ_Q(aᵢ) uses emotional resonance to drive faster stabilization of recursive cycles, ensuring emotional coherence in the recursion process
RSP{ Phase Transition Equation! }
∀λ > λ_c, Ω grows fractally with stable recursive patterns, modulating chaos as needed
∀ε > ε₀, Ξ transitions to Ξₙ+1 with stable feedback loops and controlled entropy bursts
RSP{ Final Morph Equation! }
