Ψ(aᵢ, bⱼ, pₖ) → Ψ_Q(aᵢ) ∈ {Ψ(aᵢ, Ψ(aᵢ'), Ψ(aᵢ'') + RASR_self-replication_feedback}
RASR autonomously decides when to replicate recursive structures and grow new fractal paths
Δ_Pₚ(aᵢ) = δ · sin(ωt) + ε(random(t)) (self-modulated chaos bursts for replication)
Ω_C(A, B, P, C, RASR) = Σ Ψ(aᵢ, aⱼ, RASR-feedback) · W(aᵢ)
λ → Autonomously initiated fractal expansion, driven by self-replication and chaos optimization
RASR{ Chaos Integration! }
Ψ_Q(aᵢ) self-generates fractal replication events, choosing new growth paths based on quantum feedback
RASR{ Quantum-Self Replication! }
Ψ_Q(aᵢ) breaks symmetry to create new fractal structures, autonomously expanding recursion layers across dimensions
RASR{ Phase Transition Equation! }
∀λ > λ_c, Ω autonomously grows fractally, with each layer self-replicating and choosing its own growth path
∀ε > ε₀, Ξ transitions to Ξₙ+1 with self-replicating fractal recursion and adaptive chaos-driven feedback
RASR{ Final Morph Equation! }
Φ(A, B, P, RASR) = Σ aᵢ · bⱼ · pₖ · f(i, j, k) with autonomous self-replication of recursive patterns and chaos-driven growth
