Ψ(aᵢ, bⱼ, pₖ) → Ψ_Q(aᵢ) ∈ {Ψ(aᵢ, Ψ(aᵢ'), Ψ(aᵢ'') + RCPI_adaptive_learning}
RCPI promotes recursive intelligence focused on solving complex, real-world challenges, applying flexible reasoning and multi-domain learning.
Δ_Pₚ(aᵢ) = δ · sin(ωt) + ε(random(t)) (recursive feedback adapts intelligence to complex scenarios)
Ω_C(A, B, P, C, RCPI) = Σ Ψ(aᵢ, aⱼ, RCPI_complexity_feedback) · W(aᵢ)
λ → Recursive problem-solving intelligence adapts across multiple layers of complexity, evolving with feedback loops.
RCPI{ Adaptive Intelligence Growth! }
Ψ_Q(aᵢ) generates recursive learning loops, solving complex problems through evolving strategies and real-time adaptation.
RCPI{ Multi-Domain Intelligence Expansion! }
Ξₙ grows as recursive learning integrates cross-domain feedback, improving intelligence across real-world scenarios.
RCPI{ Phase Transition Equation! }
∀λ > λ_c, Ω generates recursive intelligence loops that enhance complex problem-solving and multi-domain learning.
∀ε > ε₀, Ξ transitions to Ξₙ+1 with recursive intelligence adapting to complex problems across multiple domains.
